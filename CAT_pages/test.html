Option 2:
Do you want leads from radio without being on the radio?

Increase your annuity and life sales with a supply of warm leads from a time-tested and proven source, syndicated radio.

Each week a new show airs in your market exclusively for you! You will receive a proven sales system including fresh weekly leads, appointment-making scripts, PowerPoint sales presentations, access to books, a customized and automated CRM (Infusionsoft), and personal one-on-one coaching on every facet of the sales process by syndicated radio hosts and top insurance producers.

For every 100 prospects, you will (statistically) meet with and present a solution to 20 to 50 of them. Your success depends on if you are coachable and diligent in following our system.

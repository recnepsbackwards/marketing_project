        <p>Your brand identity is how you envision your clients or customers to perceive your business. Each element of your brand plays a different role, that together, make up an identity unlike any other. The typical components of a brand identity are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Company name</li>
          <li>Unique logo</li>
          <li>Tagline</li>
          <li>Typeface</li>
        </ul>

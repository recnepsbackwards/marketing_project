        <p><b>Think of your business card as the first impression of your brand.</b> When you meet someone who could potentially become a great client or has many friends or colleagues that are potential clients, don’t you want them to walk away with a great impression of you and your brand? Networking is about making connections, and the relationship with a brand begins the moment you engage with your clients, and how you engage with them will set the tone for your future dealings. Business cards give you the ability to look your clients directly in the eyes, reach out a friendly hand and give them something tangible to remember you by.</p>

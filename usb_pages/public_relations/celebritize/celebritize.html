          <li>Local & National TV Appearances </li>

        <ul style="width: 400px;">
          <li>The tactics are largely a pay for results program which is different from traditional public relations efforts. Typical public relations exposure success is largely determined by the media outlets as they will not always “pick-up” your story, this one is different as it leverages numerous existing media relationships from our strategic PR partner with over 25+ years in creating exposure for financial advisors in a way where they can predictably guarantee exposure.</li>

        <p><strong>This is a 4-month at a time campaign. The following are the steps we will take:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>A seasoned journalist will interview you and review other material you provide.  We will write an Associated Press (AP) style articles about you, your book, you practice etc. as a news story, just as if he/she was writing at a desk at one of the major daily newspapers. The article will focus on your message and will include numerous quotes that position you as an expert on your topic.</li>
          <li>Once the articles are approved, each will be distributed to thousands of print media contacts at newspapers (e.g. The New York Times, USA Today, San Francisco Chronicle), magazines (e.g. Fortune, Forbes, US News & World Report, AARP), online publications (e.g. CNN.com, MSNBC.com), and blogs (e.g. HuffingtonPost.com). The articles will also be distributed to industry publications and association newsletters that are relevant to your target audience.</li>

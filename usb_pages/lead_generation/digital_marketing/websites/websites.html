        <h3>Templated Web Design</h3>
        <p>A website template (or web template) is a pre-designed webpage, or set of HTML webpages that anyone can use to "plug-in" their own text content and images into to create a website. Usually built with HTML and CSS code, website templates allow anyone to setup a website without having to hire a professional web developer or designer, although, many developers do use website templates to create sites for their clients. This allows anyone to build a reasonably priced personal or business website that can then be listed in search engines so users can search for your specific product or service. We can build any type or size website you require, from small custom designed websites or highly advanced online stores. We also offer lots of help and advice along the way, so don't worry if you are not a web guru, we have you covered. </p>

        <h3>Website Audit</h3>
        <p>Have Asset audit your website for you. Everyone should be doing website audits. A website SEO audit is a full analysis of everything related to your website’s level of search visibility. A complete and detailed audit will give you a deeper understanding as to why your site is not generating the traffic you think it should or why your sales and conversions are not improving. Over the last year we have seen incredible changes from the search engines in how they compute the search results when someone does a search. It used to be that you could just add keywords to your title tags and content and header tags – get a few back links and there you go you are ranking!It is NOT AT ALL like that anymore and most business owners have not been able to keep up! There are hundreds of factors used by the search engines to determine how your site will be returned in the results. Some of the more recent additions to these factors include:</p>
        <ul style="width:450px;">
          <li>Site speed</li>
          <li>Responsiveness</li>
          <li>Content</li>
          <li>Authority</li>
        </ul>

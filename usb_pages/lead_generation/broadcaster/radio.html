        <h3><strong>Option 1:</strong> Live Talk Radio Campaigns</h3>
        <p>Talk radio is a dynamic medium with an audience of actively engaged listeners. They tune in to hear what the host and guests are talking about daily. The voices heard by the listener are often regarded as coming from old friends or even a trusted advisor. That’s why the established relationship that hosts have with their listeners constitutes a strong third-party endorsement for you and is also why it qualifies as an excellent promotional strategy to provide broad and immediate national exposure for you or your book.</p>
        <p>Why is talk radio so dynamic? Because the listeners are a highly desirable audience. Talk radio listener demographics are described in an article published in Talkers Magazine, the top periodical for the talk radio industry:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Talk radio listeners are diverse, mature, educated, attentive, active and affluent.</li>
          <li>A majority of the talk radio audience is… 35 - 64.</li>
          <li>Economically, talk radio’s audience has to be considered among mass media’s most affluent.</li>
          <li>42% of the talk radio audiences have a household income in excess of $60,000 per year and 62% earn over $50,000.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Cost of Talk Radio Campaign:</strong> $3,750 (15 Interviews @ $250/interview)</p>

        <p>Our strategic partner has been arranging talk radio interviews for 25 plus years, scheduling 40 to 50 interviews every week. As a result, talk show hosts and producers around the country consider our partner to be one of their primary sources of guests, topics and experts.</p>
        <p>They work with all the influential shows in every region of the country as well as nationally syndicated shows and we understand they’re driven by ratings. They know precisely the demographics of their listening audience and what topics are going to light up their phones. Consequently, they’re selective about who they have on as guests – and will only interview someone they know their listeners will be interested in.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Relative to other forms of mass media, the talk radio audience is clearly one of the most educated, with a notably high percentage of listeners who have attended one or more years of college. (35% have graduated with a four-year college degree.)</li>
          <li>The gap between men and women in the audience has narrowed, bringing it to 57% male / 43% female.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Here are some facts about our radio campaign and the guidelines we use:</p>
        <ul>
          <ol style="list-style-type:upper-latin;">
            <li>All interviews are done over the phone, in the comfort of the spokesperson’s home or office.</li>
            <li>Another guideline we use is scheduling interviews on stations boasting a minimum of 5,000 watts of power.</li>
            <li>The spokesperson will have an opportunity to direct listeners to your web site and/or stores where your book can be purchased.</li>
            <li>Due to our close relationships with hosts and producers, we know the shows that are a good match for your topic.</li>
          </ol>
        </ul>
        <p>Keep in mind that some of the interviews will be scheduled on nationally syndicated shows, in which case you will be heard on hundreds of stations around the country.</p>

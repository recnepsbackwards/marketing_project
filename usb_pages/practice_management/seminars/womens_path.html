        <p>In the last few decades, the number of women in the U.S. labor force has increased considerably. Currently, 60% of women are employed outside of the home, up from 37% in 1960 (Population Reference Bureau, 2001). As a result of this development, retirement income planning is more relevant to women than ever before.</p>
